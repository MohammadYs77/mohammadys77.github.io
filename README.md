# Mohammad Yousefi â€” Academic Portfolio (React + Vite + Tailwind)

This project is a lightweight React portfolio template tailored for Mohammad Yousefi.
It uses Vite, TailwindCSS and Framer Motion for simple animations.

## Quick Start

1. Extract the zip and `cd` into the folder:
```bash
cd mohammad_portfolio_react
```

2. Install dependencies (requires Node.js and npm):
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Build for production:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes
- Put your actual PDF resume at `public/resume.pdf` (replacing the placeholder) so the **Download CV** button works.
- Customize `src/sections/*` to update content.
- To deploy on GitHub Pages: build and then push the `dist` (or `build`) output to your repository `mohammadyousefi.github.io`. You can also use GitHub Actions or `gh-pages`.
