        I am apassionate and detail-oriented Artificial Intelli
gence and Data Science researcher with a strong foun
dation in deep learning, computer vision, and machine learning. 
My research interests span across medical imaging, radar-based human detection, and multi-modal 
sensor fusion. I hold an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence 
from Bahçeşehir University, where my thesis focused 
on developing a multi-modal deep learning model for 
information extraction from image–sensor datasets. I 
have published and presented my work at IEEE conferences, 
and I’m particularly interested in applying AI to 
real-world challenges that enhance human well-being 
and safety, such as healthcare, anomaly detection, and 
autonomous systems.
